# Clothing Suggestions using NLP and Web Scraping
In this repo, we have two files. "scrapper.py" is the one used to scrape data such as title, description, and link of the content from the web page. While the "clothing_suggestion.ipynb" file will contain the NLP-related tasks for finding the similarities between the text and suggesting the top 10 clothes...

## Required Libraries:
BeautifulSoup4 <br>
requests <br>
nltk <br>
scikit-learn <br>
pandas <br>
numpy <br>

## Tasks Completed:
Web scraping using Python <br>
Cleaning the data <br>
Preprocessing the data <br>
Finding Similarities <br>
Giving the top 10 results <br>

I also made a function to deploy it on a cloud platform like Google Cloud Functions, etc.
